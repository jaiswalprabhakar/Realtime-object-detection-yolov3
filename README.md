# Realtime-object-detection-yolov3
Darknet object detection framework 
This project implements an image and video object detection classifier using pretrained yolov3 models. The yolov3 models are taken from the official yolov3 paper. The yolov3 implementation is from darknet. Also, this project implements an option to perform classification real-time using the webcam.
